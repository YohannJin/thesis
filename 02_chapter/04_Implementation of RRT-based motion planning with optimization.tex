\chapter{Implementation of RRT-based motion planning with optimization } \label{ch:Implementation of RRT-based motion planning with optimization }

Here comes the introduction. Explain why the topic of your thesis is important and what is the goal of the thesis. If you need, use references like this \cite{higham2020handbook}. If you want to use acronyms, define a \textit{newacronym} in the file "sybol\_directory.tex" and use it like this: \gls{lti}. The next time you use the acronym \gls{lti} is appears authomatically in short form. 

as explanied in last chapter, in this chapter we are going to 

You can also include images like this.

A meme can be seen in Figure~\ref*{fig:Introduction:meme}. This demonstrates that 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Introduction:realisation}
	1 \le 2 \ \text{or} \ 1 \ge 2.
\end{equation}
In addition to \eqref{eq:Introduction:realisation}, it could be postulated that $1 \ne 2$. Further discussions are considered in the following sections and subsections.
